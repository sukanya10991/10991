        <p id="eye">Maleficent "Mal" Bertha is the protagonist of the Descendants franchise. She is the daughter of Maleficent and Hades.

        <p id="mal">As the movie progresses, Mal lets go of much of her former fears and goals, becoming in tune with her true self; thus she abandons the hollow life of evil, for a life of good. With friendship and love, Mal ended filling the hole in her that could not be satisfied through what her mother had taught her.</p>
